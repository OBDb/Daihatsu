## About Daihatsu

Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. is a Japanese automobile manufacturer known for specializing in small cars and compact vehicles. The company has a long history of producing efficient, affordable transportation solutions.

## Generations

### Early Years (1907-1950s)

Daihatsu's origins date back to 1907 when it was founded as Hatsudoki Seizo Co., Ltd. in Osaka, Japan. The company initially manufactured internal combustion engines for industrial applications before transitioning to vehicle production. In 1951, the company was renamed Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd., with "Daihatsu" derived from the first kanji in Osaka ("dai") and the first of the word "engine" (pronounced "hatsu" in Japanese).

### Compact Vehicle Specialization (1960s-1980s)

During this period, Daihatsu established itself as a specialist in small, efficient vehicles. The company introduced models like the Compagno in the 1960s, which was exported to European markets. In 1967, Daihatsu formed a business partnership with Toyota, which would later become a significant shareholder. The 1970s and 1980s saw the introduction of popular models such as the Charade and the Hijet mini-truck, cementing Daihatsu's reputation for practical kei cars and small passenger vehicles.

### Global Expansion (1990s-2000s)

The 1990s marked Daihatsu's increased focus on global markets with models like the Mira, Terios/Rocky compact SUV, and the Move. During this time, Daihatsu vehicles gained popularity in Southeast Asia, Europe, and other international markets. In 1998, Toyota increased its stake in Daihatsu to become the majority shareholder, strengthening the alliance between the two companies.

### Toyota Integration (2010s-Present)

In 2016, Daihatsu became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation. While maintaining its brand identity, Daihatsu has focused on developing technologies for compact vehicles and providing expertise to the Toyota group. The company continues to produce small cars primarily for Japanese and Southeast Asian markets, including models like the Tanto, Copen, and new generations of the Rocky/Terios. Daihatsu has also collaborated with Toyota on projects like the development of the Toyota Raize/Daihatsu Rocky platform.
